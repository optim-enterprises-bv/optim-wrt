 * NFLOG over raw netlink, with no GPL library.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: aether-fwlogs previously linked libnetfilter_log and
 * libnfnetlink, both GPL-2.0-or-later, while declaring BSD-3-Clause. Linking a
 * GPL library into a binary makes the combined work GPL, so the declared
 * licence was simply wrong. This file removes the dependency rather than
 * changing the declaration, because a BSD daemon was the point.
 *
 * The convenience those libraries provide is message construction and
 * attribute walking. Both are small when the message set is this narrow: bind
 * a group, set copy mode, then parse one message type. A protocol is an
 * interface, not expression -- the same reasoning that let us reimplement the
 * DynFW feed protocol.
 *
 * Nothing here is generic. It handles exactly the NFULNL messages we need and
 * refuses everything else, which is a deliberate limit: a general netlink
 * parser is a much larger attack surface for a daemon reading data that
 * ultimately originates off-device.
